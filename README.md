# predict
An algorithm to simulates weather prediction for a given location
In this code:

I define an array weatherConditions containing different weather conditions (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Stormy).
then defined an array probabilities containing the probabilities of each weather condition occurring. These probabilities should sum up to 1.
The predictWeather function generates a random number between 0 and 1, and then determines the weather condition based on the probabilities defined.
Finally, I demonstrated the usage of the function by calling it and logging the predicted weather to the console.
You can adjust the probabilities according to your preference or incorporate more sophisticated algorithms and data sources for a more accurate weather prediction. Additionally, you can integrate APIs like OpenWeatherMap or use machine learning models for more realistic predictions.
